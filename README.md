A Host file to whitelist as little as possible for Facebook and Messenger, while still making them usable!

# Use

Go to "Whitelist Management" on the Pi-hole admin page.
Copy the domains in my list and paste to blacklist as domain one at a time.

Save it by pressing "Add to Whitelist"


(A simpler way to add all at one time is coming up)
